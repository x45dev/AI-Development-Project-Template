# .env.sops.example.yaml
# This file is an example of an *unencrypted* secrets file. Values here are placeholders/comments.
# - As a once-off operation, this file needs to be encrypted using the AGE public key specified in `.sops.yaml` as the recipient.
#   Run `sops encrypt --in-place .env.sops.yaml` to encrypt it.
# - After initial encryption, run `mise run encrypt` or `sops .env.sops.yaml` to edit the encrypted file using the environment-defined EDITOR application.
