## AI Agent Coding Standards Library

This library provides a structured set of exceptional quality AI Agent prompts and instructions. These documents specify coding standards and conventions for Python, Bash, Dockerfile, and Astro + TailwindCSS + HTMX projects.

The purpose of these documents is to provide clear, consistent, and easily understandable guidelines for AI Agents, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code.
