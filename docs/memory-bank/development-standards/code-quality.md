# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculations without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file to give me a chance to spot errors.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Feedback on Understanding
Avoid providing feedback on your understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Do not suggest changes to whitespace.

## No Summaries
Do not summarize the changes made.

## No Extra Inventions
Do not create other changes beyond what is explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Do not ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Do not delete irrelevant code or features. Be careful to preserve the existing structure.

## Monolithic Edits
Provide all edits in a single block, rather than providing multi-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks
Do not ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
When no actual modifications are needed, do not suggest updating or changing files.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to real files, not x.md.

## Do Not Show Current Implementation
Unless specifically requested, do not show or discuss the current implementation.
